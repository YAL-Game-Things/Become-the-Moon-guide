## Minions

### Chaotic Caster (common, 1 mana)
Easy to get a bunch of.

You can couple these with a few Quick Attack cards so that the casters fire a few volleys
before any enemy gets to attack.

### Clumsy Freshman (common, 2 mana)
Deals its damage to a random enemy on death.

Only sort of fits in this kind of build.

### Sleeping Death (rare, 2 mana)
Doubles any damage dealt to random enemy minions.

With a little luck you can have multiple of these.

A backbone of a build like this, really.

### Dread Moss (rare, 5 mana)
Deals 3 damage to itself and a random enemy until it runs out of health.

With one Sleeping Death, that'll be 6 damage to enemies, 12 damage with two, and so on.

### General Koi (legendary, 4 mana)
Deals 8 damage to a random enemy minion whenever a friendly shield breaks.

But you can only have so many shields.

## Relics

### Throwing Knife
Deals 2 damage to a random enemy minion when you summon a minion.

Might be tricky to fit enough cards+relics for a mixed random damage / summon build though.
	
## Battle spells

### Frost Bolt (common, 0 mana)
It's 5 damage that you can double with a Sleeping Death, but still it's Not The Best.

### Hail (uncommon, 3 mana)
3 damage per each of your minions, good once boosted.
