-	The intro cutscene explains the background a bit and I'm not sure if there's an easy way to watch it again.
-	On the character select screen you can press the diamond button next to the character description to show a little lore.
-	The codex shows lore for each card and relic.
-	Beating the game with all Masterworks active shows a cutscene revealing more background about a character and their motivations.  
	You _can_ re-watch these if you beat the game with that character again.
-	The ending cutscene similarly seemingly cannot be re-watched easily so pay attention to that if you care about it.

With all of above combined, you can piece together a reasonably good picture
of what is happening in the game and how did it come to this.
