If you are feeling a little lost, the check-list is roughly as following:

Characters are mostly unlocked through randomly encountering them and beating them along the way.\
Don't stress it - you'll get all of them sooner or later.

Your codex lists all cards and relics that you have picked through your runs.
You can check on the codex from the pause menu if necessary.

Specific relics are unlocked for beating the game with a specific character
so expect a few gaps in the codex for a bit.

Beating the game for the first time unlocks an additional area and a little story plot.

Beating the game unlocks Masterworks, which are small difficulty modifiers that will be offered at some points through your run.
You don't _have_ to take them, but if you don't, no further Masterworks will be offered.

Beating the game with all of your unlocked Masterworks unlocks another one until you have them all.

Two of the relics are "prophecies".
I _think_ you need to fulfil them once (even if you don't win that run) for the grand finale?

With everything unlocked, you'll want to beat the game on each character with all Masterworks active.
