The obvious option

Personal opinion is that you should either do a battle spell build
or don't touch battle spells outside the few that have synergies with your build -
battle spells will cast instead of your minions attacking so a row of weak spells
will do you more bad than good.

## Relics

### Asteroid
Spells gain +1 spell power for each star card played this round.
If you can get a mixed magic/discard deck, you can have your fun.

### Codex Battalia
When you play a battle spell, you draw a card.\
Not too big of a deal but it helps.

### Energy Pillar
Every third battle spell played each round costs 0 mana.\
If you have enough battle spells, you can play expensive cards for free.

### Lyceum Armaments
Summons a 2/2 acolyte with Taunt on the right whenever a battle spell casts.\
Kind of neat if you get Moonlight Enchantress and/or Understudy Sonia.

### Ridiculous Hat
Gives spells +1 spell power, which is good if you are focusing on battle spells
with initial numbers of 2/3.

### Adelaide's Fiddle
Spells remain in play for an additional round.

If you rely on playing piles of cheap battle spells
for Codex Battalia / Farm Witch /etc., this may not be a good thing.

### Regimental Gong
The leader with most battle spells has +1 attack.\
It is best not to let the enemy survive until a fistfight.


## Minions
### Farm Witch (common, 2 mana)
Permanently gains +2 health whenever you play a battle spell.\
You'll need a handful of spells going to get sensible health out of these.

Having an Acclimatize is recommended to bump their attack time to time.

### Battlemage (uncommon, 3 mana)
Gain +1 mana whenever you play a battle spell.
It might be tempting to get mana from Frostbolts this way,
but free mana isn't so free when it makes your minions not attack.

### Selfish Apprentice (uncommon, 3 mana)
Permanently gains +1 attack whenever you play a spell or a battle spell.\
A welcome addition to many decks.

Similarly, Acclimatize is nice to have.

### Dragon Rider (uncommon, 4 mana)
Attacks after a battle spell casts, including Quick Cast ones.

### Amber Mage (rare, 3 mana)
Gives played battle spells +1 power, similar to Ridiculous Hat.

### Ellipsis Von Battalia (legendary)
Whenever a battle spell casts, permanently gains its (original) mana cost in attack+health.

## Battle Spells

### Frostbolt (common, 0 mana)
Sure is cheap, but mostly clutters the deck / spell row once you're past the first few fights.

### Mask Off (common, 1 mana, quick cast)
Places a 2/2 acolyte in front of your cards, which isn't a very good thing.

But at least it's a Quick Cast.

### Rise to the Occasion (common, 1 mana)
Gives your left-most minion +4 attack and Shield.

Not too bad to start with.

### Arcane Enhancement (common, 2 mana, quick cast)
Gives your minions +1/+1.

More or less worthless unless you get its spell power up.

### Fireball (uncommon, 2 mana, quick cast)
Hits the right-most enemy for 9 damage.

This isn't very nice to Amplify.

### Relax (uncommon, 2 mana)
All enemy minions gain -2 attack.

It takes a more specific build to get enough use out of these.

### Blood Mist (uncommon, 2 mana)
Whenever an enemy attacks, it gets hit for 2 damage.

There's use to this even without boosting the spell power as it will peel off shields from enemies.

Getting a few of these and/or their spell power up can make for a situation where enemy minions get
killed before they can attack your minions.

### Hail
For each friendly minion, deals 3 damage to a random enemy minion.

Mostly suitable for a Random Damage build.

### Show of Force
Summons 2/2 acolytes in front and after your minions and gives your minions +2 attack.

### Solo practitioner
Gives a random minion +1/+1; double the minion's stats if it's the only one in play.

At large this is for One Man Army builds.

### Ambush (rare, 2 mana)
Summons a 2/2 ranged acolyte with Quick Attack.
You need to Amplify this or get some summon-specific cards for it to make a difference.

### Burst (rare, 2 mana)
Activates the On Death effects of your minions.\
Increasing the spell power does nothing so this usually isn't a good fit
for a battle spell deck.

### Mimicry (rare, 3 mana)
Your left-most minion becomes an exact copy of your right-most minion.\
Largely situational, but you can duplicate your strongest/quirkiest minion this way.

### Battle Symphony (rare, 4 mana, quick cast)
Gives your minions +4/+4.\
Much like Arcane Enhancement, needs to be amplified to be useful,
but hey, at least it's Quick Cast.

### Soundstorm (rare, 6 mana)
Deals 3 damage to all enemy minions twice.
The first hit removes any potential shields from enemies
so it's a pretty big deal if you get the spell power up.

### Deep Copy (legendary, 2 mana)
Summons exact copies of other battle spells on the field.

But remember that there's a limit on battle spells on the field!

### Crescendo (legendary, 3 mana, quick cast)
Gives your other battle spells +2 spell power.

Increasing the spell power of this spell increases how much it increases power of other spells!

### Enfeebling Spores (legendary, 4 mana)
Makes the left-most enemy minion attack the right-most enemy minion.

Expensive, but useful on a few fights.

## Spells

### Warmup (uncommon, 0 mana)
Reduces the mana cost for the next battle spells by 3.\
Good for casting expensive spells!

### Amplify (uncommon, 3 mana)
Permanently increases the spell power of the drawn spell by 2!

This is good for Crescendo, or just a strong battle spell that you are keeping in play with
Bravo / Fiddle / Find / Lock.

### Harmonize (uncommon, 0-6 mana)
Permanent free +1/+2 for all your minions if you can get 3 battle spells on the field.

### Parting Song (rare, 1 mana)
Makes a battle spell stick around for an additional round and draws a card.
A good deal!

### Bravo (legendary, 1 mana)
Plays a copy of your battle spell that disappears after this turn!\
(or when it runs out of "additional rounds")
