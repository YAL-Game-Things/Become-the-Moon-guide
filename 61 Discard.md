Not _quite_ an infinite deck, but you can go places.

If you have Jack-in-the-Box (relic) and multiple ways to discard cards,
you can generate yourself large quantities of star cards.

## Other relics

### Loyalty Card
Also make the discarded cards cheaper

### Asteroid
Boost battle spells for each star card played\
... if you have any

### Filing Cabinet
Discard one card per round without having to use Rummage/etc.

### Moonlight Receiver
Boost one of your cards as you pick through the star cards.
Helps if you get it early on.

## Spells, essentials

### Rummage (common, 1 mana)
Draw 2 cards, discard 2 cards from your hand.

Good for playing Eternity Perfumes that made it to your hand.

### Scry (common, 0 mana)
Discard cards before they even make it into your hand. For free!

### Beckon the Moon (uncommon, 2 mana)
Discard the remaining cards in your draw pile!

Once your deck is big enough, this will stuff a handful of star cards into your hand,
potentially including Fish (which you can use to un-exhaust Beckon the Moon).


## Spells, extras

### Eternity Perfume (common, 3 mana)
Gives a minion +3/+3, plays when discarded.

### Mulligan (uncommon, 2 mana)
Discards your hand and draws 4 cards.

A way to get rid of a full hand and get 2-3 star cards in progress

### Deep Breath (rare, 3 mana)
Get two cheaper Meditates.

### Self-exhausting minion spells
Anything that gives minions stats/abilities - you'll be able to Fish these back and
apply them again/on other minions.


## Spells, maybes

### Euphoria (rare, 5 mana)
By the time you get this to half-decent numbers,
Stoke will outweight it while costing nothing to cast.

### Adrenaline (rare, 0 mana)
Can help with boosting cards mid-game,
but will also take up valuable hand space that could be occupied by freshly made star cards.

Hard to get rid of!

### Composting (rare, 2 mana)
in a way similar to Mulligan, but you also get mana next round.

### Overcharge (legendary, 8 mana)
Gives a minion +8/+8, costs 1 mana less for every spell cast this round.

Once you get to half-decent numbers of star cards per round, this is free to cast.

However, Stoke is also free, and will out-do this spell with.

## Minions, nice to have

### Levitator (uncommon, 3 mana)
Activated ability draws 2 cards for 2 mana.

A good way to shuffle your deck after casting casting Beckon the Moon.

### Trash Fox (uncommon, 4 mana)
Activated ability returns a discarded card to your hand for 2 mana.

Can be used to play a spell multiple times per round,
but it has to get in the discard pile first.

### Selfish Apprentice
Gains +1 attack whenever a spell is cast, and you'll be casting a lot of spells!

Get the guy an Acclimatize if you can.

### Living Conduit (legendary, 7 mana)
If you'll be casting a lot of spells to boost minions, might as well double them.

### Jar Smasher
Each Scry will reduce its +2/+2 ability cost to 0,
which is a small convenience for early/mid-game.
