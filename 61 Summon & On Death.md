This build grows visibly more powerful as you stack more minions/relics with synergies.

## Relics

### Overseer's Whip
At large makes the build work because summoned minions will attack enemies instead of stockpiling and using up your turns/desk space.

### Skull of the Taker
Gives you a Taker's Dragon once enough minions die!
Pretty important.

### Throwing Knife
Hits a random enemy for 2 damage whenever you summon a minion.\
It's not much, but it helps a bit.

### Vengeance Ring
Gives other minions +1 attack whenever a minion dies,
which will happen more often if you're summoning these.

### Tombstone
Triggers on-death effect of your left-most minion on round start.
Summon a couple minions or another dragon if you have Jean-Paul Gardinette.

### Mushroom Tea
Gives minions permanent +2 attack when their on-death effects trigger.

This is a sensible boost for minions that have to die anyway.

### Lyceum Armaments
Summon additional minions when you use battle spells

### Loudspeaker
Summon a random minion whenever a minion with Taunt dies.
Good if you can get Radicalize for your minions with on-death effects.


## Minions (on-death)

### Talent Scout (common, 1 mana)
Summons a 2/2 acolyte on death. Gotta start somewhere, right?

### Clumsy Freshman (common, 2 mana)
Deals its attack as damage to a random enemy on death.

If you get a Mushroom Tea early on, can grow to be a fairly reasonable source of damage.

And if you also get an Acclimatize...

### Spore Pod (uncommon, 2 mana)
Summons two sporelings when destroyed.

### Field Nurse (uncommon, 2 mana)
Gives a random unshielded friendly minion a Shield on death.

But it's not so much about shields, is it? Especially not random ones.

### Buried Mandrake (uncommon, 4 mana)
Subtracts 3 attack from all enemies on death.

Kind of needs its own battle spell build to be useful in mid/late-game.

### Moonlit Summoner (rare, 3 mana)
Summons a 2/2 acolyte with Cleave on death.

This can be pretty powerful when combined with Moonlight Enchantress and Summoner/Whip.

### Jean-Paul Gardinette (legendary, 3 mana)
Copy that Taker's Dragon if you have it.


## Minions (support)

### Overseer (uncommon, 3 mana)
Summoned minions attack immediately and get +2 attack.

If you have both Overseer and Whip or two Overseers,
summoned minions will ""double-strike"".

### Moonlight Enchantress (rare, 4 mana)
Summoned minions gain attack of this minion. Semi-obligatory.

### Understudy Sonia (legendary, 5 mana)
Gives minions a little more attack and Shield.

Once you are summoning enough minions, this is no longer such a good thing because the minions
will survive and stockpile until your minion limit.

### Taker's Dragon (from Skull of Taker, 0 mana)
Makes all on-death effects happen twice.
At large this is like having 2x minions with on-death effects per dragon.


## Minions (complimentary):

### Carrion Rose (common, 1 mana)
Gains +1 health for the round whenever another minion dies is _sort of_
good but in early game you probably won't have that many minions and in late game you'll want
the minion slot to be taken up by something more useful.

### Middle Manager (common, 2 mana)
Summons random common minions whenever it attacks and survives.

### Ritualist (uncommon, 2 mana)
Sort of like Throwing Knife, but as a minion.

### Lifedrinker (rare, 4 mana)
Can grow a fair bit if you get a deck going.

### General Koi (legendary, 4 mana)
If you have Sonia, this is extra 8 damage per summoned minion

## Battle spells

### Mask Off (common, 1 mana)
Summons a very regular 2/2 acolyte in front of your minion row.

### Ambush (rare, 2 mana)
Summons an acolyte with Ranged and Quick Attack.

### Burst (rare, 2 mana)
Activates On Death effects of your minions.

### Mimicry (rare, 3 mana)
A less reliable replacement for Jean-Paul Gardinette.


## Spells

### Duplicate (rare, 1 mana)
Copy that dragon or other cool minions.
