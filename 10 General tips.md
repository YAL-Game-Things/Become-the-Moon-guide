1.	The game saves at the beginning of each turn so you can undo your actions by quitting to the menu and coming back.\
	Random events will play in the same order so this will not save you from certain death,
	but it is a way to undo one-off mishaps like drafting/playing the wrong cards or playing them in wrong order.
2.	Some encounters can be "solved" in several ways instead of brute-forcing them and taking damage.\
	If something seems suspiciously strong, take a good look at enemy cards and what the enemy is
	going to do/cast.\
	A single Ban card can solve many of these.
3.	Your odds of seeing any given relic at some point of a run are slightly under 50%
	so it is a good idea to base your build on one of the three relics that you are offered
	in the beginning of a run instead of hoping that you'll timely get what you want.

Drafting:
1.	Rerolling drafted cards 1 (for free) or a few (for health) times is a good way
	to get cards that you desire or at least avoid cards that you'll never play.
2.	Certain drafts will have cards of certain rarities as the first pick.\
	Rerolling these will offer a different set of cards with that same rarity.
3.	The codex lists all cards and relics that you have picked across your runs and can be opened
	mid-session to check on what there is and what you might get if you reroll.
