## Relics

### Wing Extensions
+20% dodge chance for flying minions helps get more use out of dodge-related effects.

If you are playing a character that can get multiple of the same relic,
the effect stacks.

### Targeting Machine
Deals 10 damage to the attacker whenever a flying minion dodges.\
Wing Extensions are semi-obligatory to get much use out of this.

## Characters

### Birdsong Reverie
Play flying cards for 1 mana cheaper (and pigeons for free) while Dell is on the table.

### Captain Ego
Get two Wing Extensions or two Targeting Machines right off the bat.

### Mrs. S
Better odds of getting both Wing Extensions and Targeting Machine(s),
as well as potentially getting a game-breaking number of Wing Extensions -
so if you had 3 of these, dodge chance would be 93%..?

## Minions

### Pigeon (common, 1 mana)
Cheap, reliable

### Dove of Avon (common, 2 mana)
+1/+1 per flying minion on attack is pretty good.

If you don't have minions with Taunt,
you should stick to having one dove as the first unit
as these can get hit by enemies before they'll get to attack.

### Comet Catcher (uncommon, 3 mana)
Get 1 star card whenever a flying minion dodges an attack.\
If you get your dodge chance up and/or a few of these, you can drown yourself in star cards.

### Levitator (uncommon, 3 mana)
Draw 2 more cards for 2 mana, very good if you get your mana up and/or a supply of star cards.

### Untethered One (uncommon, 6 mana)
Plays itself when discarded, free to play if you already have Scry.

### Elusive Owl (rare, 3 mana)
Really needs Taunt and Wing Extensions to get any meaningful stat boosts

### Wing Commander (rare, 4 mana)
Gives a permanent +1/+2 boost to flying minions when they attack.\
If you have multiple Wing Commanders and/or Double Strike minions (via Go Up or Dual Wield),
you can get a pretty good boost going.

### Grand Magister Fogg (legendary, 6 mana)
Attacks after a flying minion attacks.\
If you get him flying and have Wing Commanders, Fogg will be getting quite a bit of a stat boost

## Minions (flying/magic)

### Farm witch (common, 2 mana)
Gets +2 health per battle spell cast, and you *could* do a mixed magic/flying deck...

### Amber Mage (rare, 3 mana)
Gives battle spells +1 power, but isn't this slightly expensive for using a minion slot..?

### Dragon Rider (uncommon, 4 mana)
if you're doing a magic/flying deck, you can line up Quick Cast spells
and the dragon will keep hitting enemies between the casts.

## Spells
### Go Up (uncommon, 2 mana, exhausts)
Give any card flight! 

f you get some Fish cards going, you can mix in any cards you like.
