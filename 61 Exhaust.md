To make this work you need a source of minions/cards to exhaust
and a source of cards that can exhaust them.

## Minion sources

### Portable Kiln (relic)
One free Jarling per turn

### Stubborn Bloke (minion, uncommon, 1 mana)
Can be exhausted any number of times per turn!

Hard to actually get rid of without Destroy though.

### The Jar-Headed One (legendary, 8 mana)
Similar, but also plays itself and gains +2/+2


## Minions

### Blissful Bestie (common, 2 mana)
Gains +1/+1 when a minion is exhausted.

Not much, but It's Something.

### Dumpster Diver (rare, 1 mana)
Gains +8/+8 each time it's exhausted!

### Potent Peddler (rare, 2 mana)
Complimentary, draw a card whenever you exhaust a card (up to 10 per round).

### Soul Eater (legendary, 3 mana)
If you are generating minions, you can get some use out of that as well.


## Card exhaust spells

### Unravel (spell, common, 2 mana)
Slightly less good value unless you have Portable Kiln,
which makes this a way to draw 1 more card (sans the spot that was wasted on Unravel).

### Cast Aside (spell, uncommon, 1 mana)
Don't forget that you can move exhaust-able minions back to your hand for this


## Minion exhaust spells

### Vent (spell, common, 0 mana)
Good value for Jarlings/etc.!

### Banish (spell, uncommon, 1 mana)
Also good value for 1-mana minions.

### Chaos (spell, rare, 0 mana)
You can get some value by exhausting a minion that benefits from it
and getting a minion card (that you can also exhaust) in return.

### Recycle (spell, rare, 1 mana)
Spending 1 mana to get 3 mana is pretty good,
and this is a good card even outside of exhaust builds.


## Minion recovery

### Teleport (spell, uncommon, 2 mana)
ideally you should avoid having to use Teleport.

## Relics
### Centrifuge
This is like a free Teleport but it also plays the minion to the left of your regular crew.\### Works very well for Dumpster Diver in particular.

### Manhole Cover
Boost the minions in your exhaust pile, good for Soul Eater.

### People Counter
Boosts your left-most minion's attack based on how many cards you have exhausted.

Not _that_ good since you can't bank on a temporary boost with Acclimatize..?

### Phasing Jar
Might be tempting, but on-exhaust card effects will not trigger
_and_ you won't be able to get rid of cards when you want.

### Calligraphy Pen
Just keep that Stubborn Bloke in your hand forever
