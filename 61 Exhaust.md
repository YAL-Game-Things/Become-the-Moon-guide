To make this work you need a source of minions/cards to exhaust
and a source of cards that can exhaust them

Minion sources:
-	Portable Kiln (relic
one free Jarling per turn
-	Stubborn Bloke (minion, uncommon, 1 mana
can be exhausted any number of times per turn!\
	Hard to actually get rid of without Destroy though.
-	The Jar-Headed One (legendary, 8 mana
similar, but also plays itself and gains +2/+2

Minions:
-	Blissful Bestie (common, 2 mana
gains +1/+1 when a minion is exhausted.\
	Not much, but It's Something.
-	Dumpster Diver (rare, 1 mana
gains +8/+8 each time it's exhausted!
-	Potent Peddler (rare, 2 mana
complimentary, draw a card whenever you exhaust a card (up to 10 per round).
-	Soul Eater (legendary, 3 mana
if you are generating minions, you can get some use out of that as well.

Card exhaust spells:
-	Unravel (spell, common, 2 mana
slightly less good value unless you have Portable Kiln,
	which makes this a way to draw 1 more card (sans the spot that was wasted on Unravel).
-	Cast Aside (spell, uncommon, 1 mana
don't forget that you can move exhaust-able minions back to your hand for this

Minion exhaust spells:
-	Vent (spell, common, 1 mana
good value for Jarlings/etc.!
-	Banish (spell, uncommon, 1 mana
also good value for 1-mana minions.
-	Chaos (spell, rare, 0 mana
you can get some value by exhausting a minion that benefits from it
	and getting a minion card (that you can also exhaust) in return.
-	Recycle (spell, rare, 1 mana
spending 1 mana to get 3 mana is pretty good.

Minion recovery:
-	Teleport (spell, uncommon, 2 mana
ideally you should avoid having to use Teleport.

Relics:
-	Centrifuge: this is like a free Teleport but it also plays the minion to the left of your regular crew.\
	Works very well for Dumpster Diver in particular.
-	Manhole Cover: boost the minions in your exhaust pile, good for Soul Eater.
-	People Counter: boosts your left-most minion based on how many cards you have exhausted.
-	Phasing Jar: might be tempting, but on-exhaust card effects will not trigger
	and you won't be able to get rid of cards when you want.
-	Calligraphy Pen: just keep that Stubborn Bloke in your hand forever.
