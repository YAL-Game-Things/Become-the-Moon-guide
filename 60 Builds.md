Essentials:
1.	It is a good idea to do a build around one of the relics that you are offered at the beginning
	so that you don't find yourself in a situation
	where you have everything except for the actual relic that makes your deck work.
2.	You can restart your turn by quitting to the main menu and reloading the game.  
	Note that all random events will still have the same outcomes so this will not spare you of inevitable demise if you made series of mistakes along
