General notes on

## Birdsong Reverie
This is your formal invitation to try building a deck around flying minions - a good way to get your first victory.

Having one extra unit on the field is nice too!

## Pjotter
Some types of decks can be easier to assemble when you can skip the cards that you don't need.

Plaster Cast can be used on both minions and spells,
allowing some interesting combinations with cards that you don't usually have more than a couple of.

If you're doing a build where cloning minions might be beneficial,
a Yo-Yo relic is nice to grab when offered.

## Mercy Burns
Starting with 1 mana less is easily offset by being able to cast Meditate at expense of your health.

Pain Killer is also very strong, being both a heal and a way to draw more cards cheaply.

## Captain Ego
Many number-based relics work better when there are two of them!

And having two of Red Giant makes the early fights a bit silly.

Note that Home Sickness is formally a 6-mana spell so getting Ellipsis Von Battalia on your team
is a pretty big deal.

## Allison Lycette
Getting a handful of Stoke cards in your deck is an obvious strategy,
but you can also get Academy and/or Lyceum through the Black Light relic.

Having some way to retain a Ban card is good for quirkier fights.

## Bill Decker
12 tiers with smaller choices mean that you will have more legendary cards in your deck;

Bill's exhaust card is pretty good for getting rid of cards that you didn't like.

## Poppit
And now for something different
- Since your minions auto-discard, you'll want a way to get more cards
  so that you don't run out of minions.
- Since cards cost nothing to play, you can place a card like Levitator / Trash Fox / Star Scribe, use their active ability,
  and put the card back into your hand.
- Untethered One will come back on the field after being discarded,
  which offers a little safety in case you draw no minion cards.
- As the cards auto-retain, try to finish rounds with 5 cards remaining in hand.  
  Rummage helps with getting through the cards that you can play.
- Automatic discards count towards Jack-in-the-Box.

## Slay Solari
Arguably the most straightforward character?
You stack minions together until you have One Big Boy with all of the abilities.

Having a Calligraphy Pen to retain your Pesticide card can be good for fights with Deathtouch minions.

## Hyphen Von Battalia
Have you noticed that Winner Takes All is a spell and thus is affected by any cards that boost spells?

So if you have +1 spell power, it'll give you +3 mana and +3 cards next round, but it will still cost 2 mana to cast.

Perhaps you can tell where this is going

## Mrs. S
Spoilers, kind of?

[It's Sonoya](#s)

You can get multiple copies of the same relic from Entropy Ash!

Note that you can still regain health with a Phoenix Egg in case of an emergency.

Generally the most reliable way to pursue any given build.
