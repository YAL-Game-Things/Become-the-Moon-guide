Beating the game as per Progression will get you most of the achievements;

## Lord Alderson Koi
This is linked to completing a relic's prophecy.

[(Skull of the Taker)](#s)

## Dreams Within Dreams
This is also linked to completing a relic's prophecy.

[(Sonoya's Prophecy)](#s)

## Taker's Revenge
Beat Moon-3 on the first turn of battle.

There are a handful of ways to achieve this:
- A random damage deck
- A sufficiently buffed Soundstorm on a battle spell deck
- A summon deck with Tombstone and a long enough chain of summons
- 3+ minions with Quick Attack + Double Strike + Cleave from Black Light.  
  Note that there's an increasingly slim chance that the single flying minion will dodge all of those attacks.

## One Man Army
You can swap units around but there must always be one at play when you click End Round.

I think the easiest way to get this is to take a Wishbone as Mrs. S if it's offered
as the first relic and then do a Discard build, possibly with a side of additional Wishbones
if they are offered by Entropy Ash.

- Black Light helps a bunch.
- Solo Practitioner is nice, but only if you draw it in time.
- Having a Middle Manager as your only minion can help as you'll most likely have two minions/hits by the time the enemy is out of minions.

Note that you don't have to survive Moon-3, just make it there.

You also don't even have to play with 6 Masterworks.

## Save the Cat
You've seen the cat, right?

[You shoo it away every time you enter Lyceum](#s)

[You'll need to take the cat with you](#s)

[Make a copy of it using Garden from Black Light and beat Moon-3 with the cat on the table](#s)

[You can do this on Slay Solari for added comedy.](#s)

## Startrash
I think this is by far the easiest on Slay Solari as the character is a build of its own out of box.

Similarly, you don't have to survive Moon-3.

## One Take Wonder
Beat the game with 6 masterworks on a daily challenge!\
No turn re-takes.

I think this is the easiest to get with Mrs. S or Slay Solary,
but you can play any character you like, really.

And if you mess up, there's always tomorrow.
